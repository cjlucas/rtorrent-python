v0.2.3 (Not yet released)
--------------------------------
- added: min_version argument in rtorrent.rpc.Method, this will ensure
         the method will only be available when connected to an rTorrent
         client that can actually support it.

- API CHANGES
  - General
    - RTorrent/Peer/Tracker/File/Torrent/Multicall now requires the actual 
      instance of RTorrent as and input instead of the XMLRPC 
      connection for that instance
    
    - instance methods that communicate with rTorrent will raise
      an exception if the said method is not supported by the version of
      rTorrent you're connected to:
      - will raise rtorrent.err.RTorrentVersionError if the method is newer
        than the rTorrent client
      - will raise MethodError if method isn't listed in RTorrent._rpc_methods
    
    - added is_available() function to rtorrent.rpc.Method. This function will
      check if the Method instance is supported by the instance of RTorrent
      specified
      
    - Methods for RTorrent/Peer/Torrent/etc instances will now be created
      dynamically based on the client version of rTorrent that it's connected
      to (as opposed to the old way, which deleted the original Method instance,
      and therefore was inaccessible to any future connection to rTorrent, even if 
      the rTorrent client supported said method. This will ensure that methods 
      aren't available if the client doesn't support it). You can use hasattr() 
      in order to avoid AttributeError being raised.

--------------------------
- TorrentParser now works with Python2 (Issue #2)
- Fixed a bug in which if dict keys within the torrent had spaces, those spaces would not be converted
  to underscores when parsing the torrent, making the instance variables inaccessible (TorrentParser)
