v0.2.5 (February 05, 2012)
--------------------------
- added: support for caching trackers/files/peers after calling get_torrents() (Issue #6)

- API CHANGES
  - rtorrent.Torrent
    - added: Torrent.erase()
    - added: Torrent.close()
    - changed: ratio is now converted to a float (Issue #5)
  - rtorrent.rpc.Method
    - added: post_process_func - specify a custom post processing method (Issue #4)
             (look for get_ratio Method in rtorrent.torrent for an example)
    

v0.2.4 (January 01, 2012)
-------------------------
- fixed: critical bug that caused any "set" function to throw an AssertionError
- fixed: critical bug in Torrent.start() and Torrent.stop()

v0.2.3 (December 31, 2011)
--------------------------
- added: min_version argument in rtorrent.rpc.Method, this will ensure
         the method will only be available when connected to an rTorrent
         client that can actually support it.

- API CHANGES
  - General
    - RTorrent/Peer/Tracker/File/Torrent/Multicall now requires the actual 
      instance of RTorrent as and input instead of the XMLRPC 
      connection for that instance
    
    - instance methods that communicate with rTorrent will raise
      an exception if the said method is not supported by the version of
      rTorrent you're connected to:
      - will raise rtorrent.err.RTorrentVersionError if the method is newer
        than the rTorrent client
      - will raise MethodError if method isn't listed in RTorrent._rpc_methods
      
    - Methods for RTorrent/Peer/Torrent/etc instances will now be created
      dynamically based on the client version of rTorrent that it's connected
      to (as opposed to the old way, which deleted the original Method instance,
      and therefore was inaccessible to any future connection to rTorrent, even if 
      the rTorrent client supported said method. This will ensure that methods 
      aren't available if the client doesn't support it). You can use hasattr() 
      in order to avoid AttributeError being raised.
